Pillow>=7.1  # or use pillow-simd for better performance
matplotlib  # TODO move it to optional after we add opencv visualization
pycocotools>=2.0.2  # corresponds to https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/cocoapi
# Do not add opencv here. Just like pytorch, user should install
# opencv themselves, preferrably by OS's package manager, or by
# choosing the proper pypi package name at https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python
# Also, avoid adding dependencies that transitively depend on pytorch or opencv.
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# The following are pure-python dependencies that should be easily installable.
# But still be careful when adding more: fewer people are able to use the software
# with every new dependency added.
